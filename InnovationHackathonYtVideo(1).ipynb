            "Transcription:  This is the new Nothing CMF phone one and I don't say this very often but I think this is a genius product. CMF is a new budget sub brand of the company nothing so we're talking a phone that costs 200 pounds or 250 dollars and it's actually a little bit crazy what these guys have just pulled off for that price. I mean the first thing I'll notice is this doesn't feel like just a single product launch. This is an entire ecosystem and it's really fascinating one. So let's get the phone out first. There's a Lanyard which is not something you tend to see launch with a phone. One case two cases no three cases a card wallet I guess that's for the back of the phone. There's a stand the Buds Pro 2 and then the watch Pro 2. It all feels very new because we've seen plenty of budget phones before but what you don't often get is a budget accessory ecosystem like this all designed to work specifically around that budget phone as the centerpiece. Everything has well on one hand a slightly cheap thin plastic key feel to it but then on the other hand it's all really tastefully designed. It kind of feels like all of these products have had high end thought and care put into them even if the physical materials and the finish are more basic. So like these are the CMF Buds 2 Pro and even though they're very light and clearly not a luxury item they still feel sophisticated and intentional in their design. Not like a cheap version of something that the company would rather you buy and then the watch Pro 2. Yeah it's slick clean. You never want to watch to go too crazy on design because then it won't match your outfits. So this feels like a pretty appropriate level to me. Right let's get into this phone it's a thin package so we all know what that means. Okay so the device is on top and below that is a generic white USB C to C cable which you should be able to use to transfer everything from the old phone and then an orange sim ejector. Right heel time. And right off the bat it's pretty clear that this is not your normal phone and it's not just that it looks different because you know these cases that I showed you. These are actually back plates. So if you look inside the packaging they came in you'll see a bunch of other stuff like this tool which is both a sim ejector and a screwdriver that allows you to take off these four screws on the back of your phone after which you unwind this circular piece and you're played pops off and this is a pretty big deal for a number of reasons. One that repairing this phone is going to be a lot easier and I hope cheaper than almost any other phone but that part's not confirmed. To that you don't need a case anymore you can actually use your phone naked, guilt-free knowing that if you ever do do something stupid you can just swap the back plate out for, I'm not even that much money, 29 pounds is what they're charging for these kits including the tools. The third thing is it means you can mix a match. So I really like this orange back. It swaps out the slightly cheap feeling very scratchable plastic for a more grippy, less scratchable vegan leather type finish and it's bright orange so let's put it on. But then I'm looking at the orange sim tray, the orange circle screw thing and the silver screws that come with it and thinking silver screws are pretty nice but for the other parts I think I prefer the black ones so I have just created my own two-tone finish on my phone and that's actually sick but the best part of this is that nothing has actually gone one step further to actually create an ecosystem around these weird screws and I don't even know what to call this. Now on this is the circle spinny thing. So if I want a phone stand for example unscrew your circle spinny thing and screw this down then and yeah the standard self isn't anything particularly special. It's not breaking new grounds in material science but if you decide that you want a phone stand then what better way to have a phone stand that doesn't need you to apply a sticky pad onto your case but instead physically screws into your device itself. It feels way more secure and also way more intentional like your stand was designed specifically for your phone. You want a lanyard same thing and I feel very confident that it's going to support the phone because it's bolted to it or like there's no magsafe wireless charging baked into this phone right you can't just slap one of those Apple wallets onto the back of this and expect it to hold but screw this CMF wallet enclosure in like this that's very secure and now you have your magnet to be able to attach your wallet on top of and this thing can hold like three cards this whole thing reminds me very much of a mentality that I discovered in India it's called jagad it means uh frugal innovation inventive ways to use what you have to achieve things that would normally require more resources because just by properly thinking this through before building it this company has genuinely achieved a really high level of functionality without making it cost them any more to build this thing you're actually getting something here but you can't get just by paying through the nose for a higher end device like nothing has managed to make something that gives their $250 phone a tangible leg up over my $1200 phone and that is absolutely amazing I'm mind this kind of wearing other possibilities like I'm just thinking as an example what if you use this screw and this screw to add a permanent lens attachment to your cameras you know instead of those ones that you have to clip on and anything more than a light breeze will remove for you now I would personally be a little bit worried about things getting inside they have managed to get an IPX true rating which is basically very minor water protection and nothing for dust and I think it's somewhat telling that that's the max rating they could get because yeah anything designed to be taken apart this easily is obviously not particularly well sealed and also as cool as the circles of anything is I do find it a little bit uncomfortable just because it sticks out but let me be very clear all in all for the price this is one of the best designed phones I've ever seen which I'm only half surprised by because the entire name of this sub brand CMF very literally stands for colors materials and finish it's actually the rest of the phone that surprised me more so let's talk about it if you're winning with design at $250 then where are you losing well it's not the screen this is a 120 Hertz adaptive ammo led full HD plus display it's very smooth it's sharp it's punchy this thing can display HDR 10 plus content which is a luxury that you could only get by paying over a thousand dollars like literally two years ago they've pre-installed a screen protector which I always rate and this right here is an in-display optical fingerprint scanner which is well it's fine it works even the brightness which is one of the first things to go is actually pretty good the company's advertising a 2000 net peak brightness but you don't need to achieve that in very very specific situations more typically this thing can go up to a max of 700 nets in normal brightness and then 1200 nets in ultra bright outdoor environments which means that in the absolute worst worst case scenarios you might have to squint a little bit but you'll pretty much never struggle to see it the only thing I would complain about and I'm being quite nitpicky here but the bottom bezel is slightly thicker than the other bezels and this is particularly interesting because I remember having a conversation with Carl Pay the CEO when he launched the nothing phone too he was basically explaining how much extra effort cost and engineering is required to just push this bottom lip down a tiny little bit even it all out and he made the decision to still do that on those more expensive nothing vence but now we're looking at a phone which is basically half of that cost I guess he's decided to let some of those design ideologies slip a little bit fair compromise though I still can't think of a better screen than this for 250 dollars so sure do you compromise on battery then no the phone as a 5000 million power cell the chip is actually based on the very efficient for an enemy to process the software skin is very light no thanks to the thousands of apps I've installed on top of it and I also noticed they set the phone to dark mode by default with all black icons which is good because this ammo led display will turn off anywhere it's displaying black pixels to the point where there is no doubt in my mind that I will be gracefully carried through the day by this thing like if I just pull up my battery settings now it's saying I've had four hours of screen on time and I'm still on 60% battery so I'm currently on track for this thing lasting 10 hours of screen on time on this charge which am I ever going to need more than that? Only weird thing is even though the phone is stupidly easy to take apart you still can't actually swap the battery out yourself if you decided that you're existing one is getting old which feels like a missed opportunity to me and the charging situation is okay there's no wireless charging and the wire charging is up to a pretty mediocre 33 watts but since you don't get the charging grip to achieve that wattage I imagine most people will be operating under that but the important thing is the battery life and the battery life they have nailed and you're not compromising with the software either this phone runs nothing OS 2.6 based on Android 14 and I love the software skin it's light it doesn't interfere too much with what stock Android already does well but where it does it's little thoughtful things to either make your phone more aesthetic or make it less distracting there's an AI generator tool for wallpapers which is quite limited in options it would be nice if you could at least specify the colour you wanted but equally it does turn out reliably good results they never seem to look too AI generated if you're not mean and you're getting that with two years of major Android updates and three years of security updates which is no doubt a big part of where money is saved compared to the more expensive nothing for two for example it's not a bad level of support it's pretty standard at this tier it's just it's nothing spectacular but it's the chip inside this phone that for me was the biggest wildcard I had no idea what to expect the phone's got six gigabytes of RAM on the base model and 128 gigs of storage interestingly expandable storage with up to a two terabyte SD card and it's paired with a media tech chip set the Dimensity 7300 and the reason that I didn't know what to expect is well at least on paper the Dimensity 7300 is actually less powerful than the 7200 which someone please explain the math to me but anyway this is what that looks like in practice so this is the latest game from Hoyovers the company who made Genshin Impact and providing them on game mode which you can access by just swiping in from the left I can play it at a pretty acceptable frame rate hovering up mostly high settings but even though there is a liquid cooling system on the inside I have noticed the performance declining with prolonged gaming so if I don't want it to get lag here then I'll get a more stable experience if I go down to medium settings so if you factor in that this is as demanding as mobile games get it then there isn't anything that you won't be able to play but you will have to make noticeable compromises to help some games look and on a day-to-day basis it doesn't feel slow but it also doesn't feel particularly fast the phone is mostly smooth with the occasional jitter every now and again but the thing that I noticed more is every time you click something or open an app or try to load something it takes just a little bit of time it's not like you're waiting around but there's just a fraction of thinking time with each action would I have expected anything different for a phone at this price no not really it's actually just that most of the phone is so good that it makes you forget how much it costs and I'm actually in my mind benchmarking it against much more expensive prices audio is probably the most obvious downgrade I noticed it's just a very simple mono speaker at the bottom you don't get any kind of stereo effect using the earpiece as a second speaker and you lose a little bit of the sophistication of your music when listening through it but I also wouldn't go as far as to say that it's a bad speaker and it is actually rather loud so then what this really came down to for me was the cameras if nothing managed to do all of what they've done and also smash it with the cameras then this thing was going straight to the whole of fame but equally this is where I was expecting a big noticeable dip in the phone experience so I slowly approached that camera button fully ready to lose a chunk of respect for this device do you know what these mad lads have kind of done it so the phone has two cameras but it's a little bit of weird one because the top camera is actually just on a sister camera you can hold your finger over it and still perform basically every single function of your phone's camera the only thing that you can't do without it is add the portrait mode effect to your shots so if I take this photo while covering the lens it'll look like this if I take the same photo after having removed my finger it will look like this what are those photos look like well very nicely detailed you have plenty of room to zoom in further and they will still look sharp the wide aperture and decent sensor size gets you some nice foreground background separation and mostly flawless high dynamic range I say mostly just because it's absolutely spot on for big scenes where there's an overexposed sky but it often misses the small things like a bright light bulb in your shop that needs controlling and you know what the video has no right to look this decent the phone shoots 4k footage at 30 frames per second and it doesn't feel particularly noisy which you might expect to do since this phone's chip doesn't have the best image signal processor it doesn't feel massively unstable which you might expect to give that this camera has no optical image stabilisation and the focusing isn't jittery which you might expect to give that there's no laser order focus or anything close to it the hardware of these cameras is nothing special for the price but it's the attention to fine tuning what is there that's the reason that you can record footage like this now for me there are four things that I felt have been a bit lacking the color science it's perfectly fine with most flowers and objects but it's faces that it really struggles with it's not a bit small but side by side with a top headphone it becomes very clear how much of that super intelligent fine tuning that you might have come to expect that you're missing out on the portraits which feel pretty fine in isolation but again next to a top headphone it doesn't take a detective to see the subtle nuances being lost the zooming experience is pretty bad the fact that there's no dedicated zoom camera combined with the lack of AI intelligence to know what to do without it means that zooming in 10 times here really does feel that you just took a photo to a one times and blew it up 10 times it's not pretty and then finally there's no ultra wide camera and I can I can kind of see why because obviously they're not going to have a lot of spare budget to add in a good one and so adding in a cheap one just for the sake of it might make the overall camera feel worse but it is still a lacking feature the key thing to bear in mind though is compare this camera to any phone in its own price range and I would say it's at least as good I just want to make it clear what you're not getting so the long and short of it is the CMA phone one is maybe the most instantly recognizable phone I have ever used we've seen this formula before company launches a new sub brand company wants to generate hype for that sub brand so company makes the first offering in that sub brand particularly generous point being it might not stay this way but that doesn't change the fact that for what this is right now at this price it feels like a complete steel to me\n",

              "\" This is the new Nothing CMF phone one and I don't say this very often but I think this is a genius product. CMF is a new budget sub brand of the company nothing so we're talking a phone that costs 200 pounds or 250 dollars and it's actually a little bit crazy what these guys have just pulled off for that price. I mean the first thing I'll notice is this doesn't feel like just a single product launch. This is an entire ecosystem and it's really fascinating one. So let's get the phone out first. There's a Lanyard which is not something you tend to see launch with a phone. One case two cases no three cases a card wallet I guess that's for the back of the phone. There's a stand the Buds Pro 2 and then the watch Pro 2. It all feels very new because we've seen plenty of budget phones before but what you don't often get is a budget accessory ecosystem like this all designed to work specifically around that budget phone as the centerpiece. Everything has well on one hand a slightly cheap thin plastic key feel to it but then on the other hand it's all really tastefully designed. It kind of feels like all of these products have had high end thought and care put into them even if the physical materials and the finish are more basic. So like these are the CMF Buds 2 Pro and even though they're very light and clearly not a luxury item they still feel sophisticated and intentional in their design. Not like a cheap version of something that the company would rather you buy and then the watch Pro 2. Yeah it's slick clean. You never want to watch to go too crazy on design because then it won't match your outfits. So this feels like a pretty appropriate level to me.

              "\" This is the new Nothing CMF phone one and I don't say this very often but I think this is a genius product. CMF is a new budget sub brand of the company nothing so we're talking a phone that costs 200 pounds or 250 dollars and it's actually a little bit crazy what these guys have just pulled off for that price. I mean the first thing I'll notice is this doesn't feel like just a single product launch. This is an entire ecosystem and it's really fascinating one. So let's get the phone out first. There's a Lanyard which is not something you tend to see launch with a phone. One case two cases no three cases a card wallet I guess that's for the back of the phone. There's a stand the Buds Pro 2 and then the watch Pro 2. It all feels very new because we've seen plenty of budget phones before but what you don't often get is a budget accessory ecosystem like this all designed to work specifically around that budget phone as the centerpiece. Everything has well on one hand a slightly cheap thin plastic key feel to it but then on the other hand it's all really tastefully designed. It kind of feels like all of these products have had high end thought and care put into them even if the physical materials and the finish are more basic. So like these are the CMF Buds 2 Pro and even though they're very light and clearly not a luxury item they still feel sophisticated and intentional in their design. Not like a cheap version of something that the company would rather you buy and then the watch Pro 2. Yeah it's slick clean. You never want to watch to go too crazy on design because then it won't match your outfits. So this feels like a pretty appropriate level to me. Right let's get into this phone it's a thin package so we all know what that means. Okay so the device is on top and below that is a generic white USB C to C cable which you should be able to use to transfer everything from the old phone and then an orange sim ejector. Right heel time. And right off the bat it's pretty clear that this is not your normal phone and it's not just that it looks different because you know these cases that I showed you. These are actually back plates. So if you look inside the packaging they came in you'll see a bunch of other stuff like this tool which is both a sim ejector and a screwdriver that allows you to take off these four screws on the back of your phone after which you unwind this circular piece and you're played pops off and this is a pretty big deal for a number of reasons. One that repairing this phone is going to be a lot easier and I hope cheaper than almost any other phone but that part's not confirmed. To that you don't need a case anymore you can actually use your phone naked, guilt-free knowing that if you ever do do something stupid you can just swap the back plate out for, I'm not even that much money, 29 pounds is what they're charging for these kits including the tools. The third thing is it means you can mix a match. So I really like this orange back. It swaps out the slightly cheap feeling very scratchable plastic for a more grippy, less scratchable vegan leather type finish and it's bright orange so let's put it on. But then I'm looking at the orange sim tray, the orange circle screw thing and the silver screws that come with it and thinking silver screws are pretty nice but for the other parts I think I prefer the black ones so I have just created my own two-tone finish on my phone and that's actually sick but the best part of this is that nothing has actually gone one step further to actually create an ecosystem around these weird screws and I don't even know what to call this. Now on this is the circle spinny thing. So if I want a phone stand for example unscrew your circle spinny thing and screw this down then and yeah the standard self isn't anything particularly special. It's not breaking new grounds in material science but if you decide that you want a phone stand then what better way to have a phone stand that doesn't need you to apply a sticky pad onto your case but instead physically screws into your device itself. It feels way more secure and also way more intentional like your stand was designed specifically for your phone. You want a lanyard same thing and I feel very confident that it's going to support the phone because it's bolted to it or like there's no magsafe wireless charging baked into this phone right you can't just slap one of those Apple wallets onto the back of this and expect it to hold but screw this CMF wallet enclosure in like this that's very secure and now you have your magnet to be able to attach your wallet on top of and this thing can hold like three cards this whole thing reminds me very much of a mentality that I discovered in India it's called jagad it means uh frugal innovation inventive ways to use what you have to achieve things that would normally require more resources because just by properly thinking this through before building it this company has genuinely achieved a really high level of functionality without making it cost them any more to build this thing you're actually getting something here but you can't get just by paying through the nose for a higher end device like nothing has managed to make something that gives their $250 phone a tangible leg up over my $1200 phone and that is absolutely amazing I'm mind this kind of wearing other possibilities like I'm just thinking as an example what if you use this screw and this screw to add a permanent lens attachment to your cameras you know instead of those ones that you have to clip on and anything more than a light breeze will remove for you now I would personally be a little bit worried about things getting inside they have managed to get an IPX true rating which is basically very minor water protection and nothing for dust and I think it's somewhat telling that that's the max rating they could get because yeah anything designed to be taken apart this easily is obviously not particularly well sealed and also as cool as the circles of anything is I do find it a little bit uncomfortable just because it sticks out but let me be very clear all in all for the price this is one of the best designed phones I've ever seen which I'm only half surprised by because the entire name of this sub brand CMF very literally stands for colors materials and finish it's actually the rest of the phone that surprised me more so let's talk about it if you're winning with design at $250 then where are you losing well it's not the screen this is a 120 Hertz adaptive ammo led full HD plus display it's very smooth it's sharp it's punchy this thing can display HDR 10 plus content which is a luxury that you could only get by paying over a thousand dollars like literally two years ago they've pre-installed a screen protector which I always rate and this right here is an in-display optical fingerprint scanner which is well it's fine it works even the brightness which is one of the first things to go is actually pretty good the company's advertising a 2000 net peak brightness but you don't need to achieve that in very very specific situations more typically this thing can go up to a max of 700 nets in normal brightness and then 1200 nets in ultra bright outdoor environments which means that in the absolute worst worst case scenarios you might have to squint a little bit but you'll pretty much never struggle to see it the only thing I would complain about and I'm being quite nitpicky here but the bottom bezel is slightly thicker than the other bezels and this is particularly interesting because I remember having a conversation with Carl Pay the CEO when he launched the nothing phone too he was basically explaining how much extra effort cost and engineering is required to just push this bottom lip down a tiny little bit even it all out and he made the decision to still do that on those more expensive nothing vence but now we're looking at a phone which is basically half of that cost I guess he's decided to let some of those design ideologies slip a little bit fair compromise though I still can't think of a better screen than this for 250 dollars so sure do you compromise on battery then no the phone as a 5000 million power cell the chip is actually based on the very efficient for an enemy to process the software skin is very light no thanks to the thousands of apps I've installed on top of it and I also noticed they set the phone to dark mode by default with all black icons which is good because this ammo led display will turn off anywhere it's displaying black pixels to the point where there is no doubt in my mind that I will be gracefully carried through the day by this thing like if I just pull up my battery settings now it's saying I've had four hours of screen on time and I'm still on 60% battery so I'm currently on track for this thing lasting 10 hours of screen on time on this charge which am I ever going to need more than that? Only weird thing is even though the phone is stupidly easy to take apart you still can't actually swap the battery out yourself if you decided that you're existing one is getting old which feels like a missed opportunity to me and the charging situation is okay there's no wireless charging and the wire charging is up to a pretty mediocre 33 watts but since you don't get the charging grip to achieve that wattage I imagine most people will be operating under that but the important thing is the battery life and the battery life they have nailed and you're not compromising with the software either this phone runs nothing OS 2.6 based on Android 14 and I love the software skin it's light it doesn't interfere too much with what stock Android already does well but where it does it's little thoughtful things to either make your phone more aesthetic or make it less distracting there's an AI generator tool for wallpapers which is quite limited in options it would be nice if you could at least specify the colour you wanted but equally it does turn out reliably good results they never seem to look too AI generated if you're not mean and you're getting that with two years of major Android updates and three years of security updates which is no doubt a big part of where money is saved compared to the more expensive nothing for two for example it's not a bad level of support it's pretty standard at this tier it's just it's nothing spectacular but it's the chip inside this phone that for me was the biggest wildcard I had no idea what to expect the phone's got six gigabytes of RAM on the base model and 128 gigs of storage interestingly expandable storage with up to a two terabyte SD card and it's paired with a media tech chip set the Dimensity 7300 and the reason that I didn't know what to expect is well at least on paper the Dimensity 7300 is actually less powerful than the 7200 which someone please explain the math to me but anyway this is what that looks like in practice so this is the latest game from Hoyovers the company who made Genshin Impact and providing them on game mode which you can access by just swiping in from the left I can play it at a pretty acceptable frame rate hovering up mostly high settings but even though there is a liquid cooling system on the inside I have noticed the performance declining with prolonged gaming so if I don't want it to get lag here then I'll get a more stable experience if I go down to medium settings so if you factor in that this is as demanding as mobile games get it then there isn't anything that you won't be able to play but you will have to make noticeable compromises to help some games look and on a day-to-day basis it doesn't feel slow but it also doesn't feel particularly fast the phone is mostly smooth with the occasional jitter every now and again but the thing that I noticed more is every time you click something or open an app or try to load something it takes just a little bit of time it's not like you're waiting around but there's just a fraction of thinking time with each action would I have expected anything different for a phone at this price no not really it's actually just that most of the phone is so good that it makes you forget how much it costs and I'm actually in my mind benchmarking it against much more expensive prices audio is probably the most obvious downgrade I noticed it's just a very simple mono speaker at the bottom you don't get any kind of stereo effect using the earpiece as a second speaker and you lose a little bit of the sophistication of your music when listening through it but I also wouldn't go as far as to say that it's a bad speaker and it is actually rather loud so then what this really came down to for me was the cameras if nothing managed to do all of what they've done and also smash it with the cameras then this thing was going straight to the whole of fame but equally this is where I was expecting a big noticeable dip in the phone experience so I slowly approached that camera button fully ready to lose a chunk of respect for this device do you know what these mad lads have kind of done it so the phone has two cameras but it's a little bit of weird one because the top camera is actually just on a sister camera you can hold your finger over it and still perform basically every single function of your phone's camera the only thing that you can't do without it is add the portrait mode effect to your shots so if I take this photo while covering the lens it'll look like this if I take the same photo after having removed my finger it will look like this what are those photos look like well very nicely detailed you have plenty of room to zoom in further and they will still look sharp the wide aperture and decent sensor size gets you some nice foreground background separation and mostly flawless high dynamic range I say mostly just because it's absolutely spot on for big scenes where there's an overexposed sky but it often misses the small things like a bright light bulb in your shop that needs controlling and you know what the video has no right to look this decent the phone shoots 4k footage at 30 frames per second and it doesn't feel particularly noisy which you might expect to do since this phone's chip doesn't have the best image signal processor it doesn't feel massively unstable which you might expect to give that this camera has no optical image stabilisation and the focusing isn't jittery which you might expect to give that there's no laser order focus or anything close to it the hardware of these cameras is nothing special for the price but it's the attention to fine tuning what is there that's the reason that you can record footage like this now for me there are four things that I felt have been a bit lacking the color science it's perfectly fine with most flowers and objects but it's faces that it really struggles with it's not a bit small but side by side with a top headphone it becomes very clear how much of that super intelligent fine tuning that you might have come to expect that you're missing out on the portraits which feel pretty fine in isolation but again next to a top headphone it doesn't take a detective to see the subtle nuances being lost the zooming experience is pretty bad the fact that there's no dedicated zoom camera combined with the lack of AI intelligence to know what to do without it means that zooming in 10 times here really does feel that you just took a photo to a one times and blew it up 10 times it's not pretty and then finally there's no ultra wide camera and I can I can kind of see why because obviously they're not going to have a lot of spare budget to add in a good one and so adding in a cheap one just for the sake of it might make the overall camera feel worse but it is still a lacking feature the key thing to bear in mind though is compare this camera to any phone in its own price range and I would say it's at least as good I just want to make it clear what you're not getting so the long and short of it is the CMA phone one is maybe the most instantly recognizable phone I have ever used we've seen this formula before company launches a new sub brand company wants to generate hype for that sub brand so company makes the first offering in that sub brand particularly generous point being it might not stay this way but that doesn't change the fact that for what this is right now at this price it feels like a complete steel to me\""
